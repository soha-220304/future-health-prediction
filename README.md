# future-health-prediction
The inspiration to create this code is that ,where humans technically able to analyze their upcoming health conditions based on their past health data and past health conditions where care and precautions can be taken before head as they always says  "PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE!"
Here i have used random forest classifier algorithm
Random Forest Classifier: This is the core machine learning algorithm employed for prediction.
It belongs to the ensemble learning family, specifically a bagging method.
It works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Known for its good accuracy, robustness to overfitting, and ability to handle high-dimensional data.
